# alien-shooter
A 2D space shooter game built with Python and Pygame. Shoot down alien fleets in increasingly difficult levels. Created as one of my first projects by following the Alien Invasion example from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arieth07/alien-shooter.git
cd alien-shooter
```

### 2. Create and activate a Conda environment (recommended)

```bash
conda create -n aliens python=3.10 pygame -c conda-forge
conda activate aliens
```

### 3. Run the game

```bash
python alien_invasion.py
```

## Notes

- Make sure you have [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installed.
- If you prefer `pip`, you can install dependencies with:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys to move the ship.
- Press the spacebar to fire bullets.
- Press 'Q' to quit the game.

Enjoy playing!
